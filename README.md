# Seattleairnbnb_exploratoryanalysis
This repository is created to share my analysis of Seattle Airbnb  market. The project is done as a part of Udacity Data scientist Course. In this project, Airbnb Seattle data is explored to gain business related insights.

# 1. Installations
The required libraries for running the code within Jupiter notebook are part of the Anaconda distribution for Python 3.6.2. Following libraries were used:

pandas
numpy
collections
datetime
sklearn
wordcloud
matplotlib
csv

# 2. Project Motivation
This project explored the utility of Airbnb, Seattle dataset for obtaining insights to remain competitive in the market. The CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) pipeline was followed focussing on insights for "How to make your listing competitive?". The specific questions were:

Pricing Trends : Is there a price variation by neighbourhood?
Sentiment Analysis of Reviews : How can we categorize reviews based on sentiments? Are reviews more positive for higher priced neighbourhoods?
Price Prediction : Can we predict price for a given listing? What factors of the listing correlate best for predicting price?

This notebook presents the word related to addressing the above questions. The code for cleaning, engineering, and modeling data along with the markdown describing the process is presented.

These data required to perform the analysis is available at - https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data 

# 4. How to interact with the project
The necessary steps for the entire data analysis pipeline is described in a step-wise manner in the Jupyter notebook. The data can be downloaded from here. Following data download the notebook cells can be re-run without changes or modifications can be made that attempt to improve upon the existing analysis. A summary of major insight gained from the analysis includes:

a) Neighborhood groups play an important role in price determination. However, in combination with other features of listing the price can set to gain suitable profit margins.
b) Some neighbourhoods have more positive reviews vs. others owing to multiple features that are not explored in this project. However, positive reviews does not mean higher price capabilities for the regions. 

The major findings can be found at the post here - https://medium.com/p/b2aa2ae1acaf/edit

# 5. Licensing and Acknowledgements
The licensing for the data and related information can be found in the Kaggle link available here. I would like to thank the mentors at Udacity for coaching necessary background skills in Data Analysis.
